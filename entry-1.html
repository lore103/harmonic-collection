        This photo was taken back in August 2020 in Hong Kong.  This was one of the last times where my high school friends and I were 
        all together in the same place and same time.  Because of the pandemic, we weren’t even able to have an actual graduation prom.
          Instead, we booked a venue and took pictures instead with our dresses.  We all got ready together and tried on our dresses.  
          We all had really poofy colourful dresses and it was so fun to just see everyone’s gown.  Of course, prom isn’t the same 
          without the actual event.  Having a high school prom is definitely a once in a lifetime type of memory.  We weren’t able to 
          have that but being with my close friends instead of the whole year group felt a lot more special.  It was pretty emotional 
        seeing us all together for the last time until god knows how long.  Even though it’s a bittersweet moment, my heart felt so 
        full after this.  </p>
