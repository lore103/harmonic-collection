        This photo was taken when I went to HKMOA (Hong Kong Museum of Art) with my
        friend.  We were supposed to go to an art and design exhibition at a 
        university in Hong Kong but they 
        didn’t allow walk-in visits from outside visitors.  Therefore we ended up 
        at the museum.  There were a lot of cool exhibits.  I went there recently 
        with another friend but we didn’t thoroughly look at the exhibits so being 
        able to this time was really satisfying.  The picture was taken with 
        tungsten film so the effect turned out really nice.  I also didn’t use 
        flash for the picture so the colour from the screen looks really vibrant.  
        The colours also look as if they’re glowing which adds a lot to the 
        photograph.  For this roll of film, including this photo, I used ISO 400 which is creates a
      really nice light and dark contrast.</p>
