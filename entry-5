        I took this photo during this summer in Hong Kong.  I associate a lot of my memories with this park of this playground and to 
        this day it’s still my favourite park ever.  When I moved here from the US when I was 4, I would go to the playground with my 
        dad every weekend and sometimes we would go through the park to get to the library.  Whenever my friends come visit me in that 
        area I would also bring them here.  Every mid-autumn festival my dad and I would light our lanterns and walk around the park.  
        I even made a still-life watercolour piece for my portfolio of the playground in the park.  This park has a very special place in my heart and seeing it again this summer brings back a lot of memories.  Seeing it again 
        makes me reminisce the times and feelings of experiencing things for the first time as a child, like going to the playground or 
        lighting up lanterns or even meeting up with a boy.  I know I’m still young and I have so much I have yet to experience.  
        However, there is so much adrenaline and excitement when moments like this happen when you are younger.  </p1>
