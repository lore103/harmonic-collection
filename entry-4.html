      This is one of my favourite photographs from a concert that I went to in February.  The band playing was Valley and it was in 
      Irving Plaza.  I had so much fun at this concert especially since I had covid a week before.  I also was non-stop listening to 
      them before and during quarantine so when I knew they were coming to NYC, I knew I had to go.  The opening artist was Catie 
      Turner and she was a contestant on American Idol.  I absolutely loved the energy when Valley came on and it was so nice to hear 
      them live.  I was also pretty near the front, around second row.  I tried taking some film pictures of them but I wasn’t tall 
      enough so there were some shots where u can just see the heads of the people in front.  Even so, some of the photos turned out 
      really good.  I posted the photo I took on my film instagram account and the main vocalist (@atlasbroker) and the account of the 
      band (@thisisvalley) liked the picture which made me feel so flattered.  The title of this entry ‘sucks to see you doing better’ 
      is my favourite song from them and was even one of my top songs for 2021 on spotify.  </p1>
