        This is a snapshot from a fashion magazine photoshoot for a friend in April 2022.  In the photograph 
        above is my friend Drithi and I.  I remember doing this photoshoot and being so exhausted from a night out, 
        hence why I look so tired in the photo.  We were supposed to start shooting in the morning at around 10am but 
        we ended up just meeting up at 2pm that day.  We did our own makeup and hair based on what our friend preferred.  Despite being exhausted, 
        we got to try on so many different clothes and it was so fun posing in front of the camera.  For a lot of the photos we looked 
        insanely tall compared to our actual height and you can’t really tell how tall we actually are in those pictures.  
        Most of the photos were taken on a Canon DSLR but we took a few photos on a disposable film camera.  This was also one of the first times
         I modelled for someone’s project which did make me feel so flattered but it was also stressful because it was my friend’s final :o.</p1>
