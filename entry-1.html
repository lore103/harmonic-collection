            This photo was taken back in August 2020 in Hong Kong.  This was one of the last times where my high school friends and I 
            were all together in the same place and same time.  Because of the pandemic, we weren’t even able to have an actual graduation
            prom.  Instead, we booked a venue and took pictures instead with our dresses.  Of course, prom isn’t the same without the 
            actual event.  However, my heart felt so full after this. </p>
