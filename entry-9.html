      I took these photos while quarantining in Hong Kong for a week.  After watching so many movies and finishing the second season 
      of Euphoria I was experimenting with the different makeup looks from the show.  After trying out a specific eye look, I decided 
      to take some photos with my film camera since I was really bored.  I used the self-timer effect on it and got inspiration from 
      Pinterest of different hotel room pictures.  From those photos I tried to pick out a more classic and basic outfit, which was a 
      bit more difficult because I didn’t have as many sophisticated pieces with me.  It was fun but it was definitely a struggle trying
       to balance the camera on different objects since I didn’t have a tripod.  The pictures definitely turned out really nice which 
       I’m extremely happy about.  I used Adobe Lightroom to adjust the size and colours of the photo.  </p>
