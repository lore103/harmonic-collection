        This is a photograph within a cute photoshoot I did with my friend Kristi.  She let me do her makeup and I wanted to do the 
        makeup I usually do on myself on her because we used to get mistaken for each other a lot.  I even asked her to wear my top.  
        When we were in middle school we looked really similar and had a lot of the same features.  Obviously now we look quite 
        different but it was still fun to do her makeup.  After doing her makeup, we even did a poll on our instagrams to see if 
        people would think she was me and some people did which we then laughed about for an hour.  The photoshoot was so random and 
        I just took pictures with the most random things in my house.  This is one of my favourite shots because of all the different
         things that were in my fridge and I think the colours of the milk and watermelon suits the photo really well.  The one thing 
         I wish I could change about this picture is the focus.  It is more focused on the fridge content rather than the person which 
         is one thing that really annoys me about this camera.  </p1>
